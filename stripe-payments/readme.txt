Easily accept payments on your WordPress site via Stripe payment gateway.

== Description ==

The Stripe Payments plugin allows you to accept credit card payments via Stripe payment gateway on your WordPress site easily.

It has a simple shortcode that lets you put Stripe "Buy Now" buttons anywhere on your site for a product or service. You can accept donation via Stripe also.

One click payment via Stripe with a remember me feature. Responsive design so it is compatible with all devices and browsers.

Your customers will be redirected to the "Checkout Result" page after the credit card payment. This page shows them the details of the transaction (the item that they just paid for).

The transaction info is also captured in the orders menu of the plugin. You can view all the payments you received from your WordPress admin dashboard.
